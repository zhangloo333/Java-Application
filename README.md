Circuit NodAL Analysis Application (Object Oriented Programing MVC Model)

## Java Circuite Nodal Analysis Application

Developed an circuit analysis application, which supported to draw circuits to edit elements (wires,
resistors, voltage, and current sources), to read and write text file operations; This software can support
user to generated circuit diagram and properties of elements by moving mouse to move, add, delete, and simulate
real circuits. This application is based on MVC design model and implement 80% functions of <b>LTspice IV</b>(circuit
design software) , this application is for free.)

## Technology
